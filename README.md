# StoreLauncher
StoreLauncher is a tutorial Android app to showcase the best way to launch a 3rd party app store or the default play store app for the application.
This is useful if you have published your android app in a 3rd party app store other than the Google Play store. For instance, if your app is published in China, along with the rest of the world.
